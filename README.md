## Introduction

Bikino Sinc is a beautifully designed fashion store by [Broklin Onjei](https://dribbble.com/shots/14848839-Web-Design-2020-Beginning). The project is built using [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with a live deployment to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). When I first saw one of the shots on dribbble, I fell in love with it and knew I wanted to build it. Nevertheless, this is not a 1:1 version that perfectly captures the design from the shots, as that was not the goal. The main area I focused on was unit testing, the use of [script setup](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) and typescript.

## Features

- Home page that includes the following sections: hero, explore more with 5 sample products from the store, categories and footer with a list of stores and a button to modal with Google Maps

- Category list page, after selecting a category you'll be redirected to the shop page where you can view products within that category

- Product page where you can read about the product, choose a variant and add it to your cart

- A checkout page that captures shopping cart items into an order (a test payment gateway is set up, which allows you to place a real order in the system and receive an email notification)

- Shop page for products (includes pagination, sorting, filtering by category)

- Shopping cart (adding products to the cart, increasing or decreasing the quantity of a product, removing products from the cart, emptying the entire cart)

- Order confirmation page to display successful orders 

- Search for products

- 404 page
